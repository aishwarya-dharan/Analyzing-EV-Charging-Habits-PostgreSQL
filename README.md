PostgreSQL project analyzing electric vehicle charging behavior exploring usage patterns, charging duration and station performance through SQL queries.
# Analyzing Electric Vehicle Charging Habits (PostgreSQL)

This project explores how electric vehicle (EV) drivers use charging stations uncovering insights​ into charging frequency, session duration, and popular locations.

---

## Project Overview
Using a real-world dataset of EV charging sessions, this analysis answers key questions such as:
- Which charging stations are used most frequently?
- What is the average duration of a charging session?
- How does charging behavior vary by vehicle type and location?

The project focuses on writing **efficient SQL queries** to extract, aggregate, and interpret data from multiple tables.

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- SQL querying with **PostgreSQL**
- **Data aggregation** and **JOIN operations**
- **Subqueries**, **window functions**, and **common table expressions (CTEs)**
- Analytical reasoning and data interpretation
- Communicating findings with SQL outputs and observations

## Tools & Technologies
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **DataCamp Workspace**

---

## Key Insights
- Peak charging times show strong correlation with commuting hours.  
- A small number of stations handle the majority of sessions.  
- Average session duration increases significantly on weekends.
